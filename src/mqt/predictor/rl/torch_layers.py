    Combined features extractor for Dict observation spaces.
    Builds a features extractor for each key of the space. Input from each space
    is fed through a separate submodule (CNN or MLP, depending on input shape),
    the output features are concatenated and fed through additional MLP network ("combined").

    :param observation_space:
    :param cnn_output_dim: Number of features to output from each CNN submodule(s). Defaults to
        256 to avoid exploding network sizes.
    :param normalized_image: Whether to assume that the image is already normalized
        or not (this disables dtype and bounds checks): when True, it only checks that
        the space is a Box and has 3 dimensions.
        Otherwise, it checks that it has expected dtype (uint8) and bounds (values in [0, 255]).
