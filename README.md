# MQT Predictor: Automatic Prediction of Good Compilation Paths
MQT Predictor is a framework to create a software tool suggesting a compilation options to use for an arbitrary quantum circuit according to the user's needs.
This software can be used in two ways:
1) User-specific instantiation
2) Usage of the pre-trained model used in the experimental evaluations of the corresponding [reference](#reference)
